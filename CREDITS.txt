CREDITS OF THE GAME SECTION

During those years the Game Section has been developed, many people have put
their time in developing the Game Section to the product it is now. Meaning
people reporting bugs, advise fixes, translating to their own language, giving
support to other people. Those people aren't listed here, as it would be an
impossible task to make such a list complete, but, to anybody listening to this
description: thanks!

At the moment, most notable and active for current development are:
Development: Paretje
Forum Support: Jockl
